# Advent of Code 2021

See <https://adventofcode.com/2021> for problem descriptions.

This year I decided to use Java, since I am already very comfortable with it. This allows me to devote less time and
still make solutions look nice (to my eyes), which is something I enjoy doing. I'm using an
[early access](https://jdk.java.net/loom/) build of project Loom to play with the latest Java goodies.

Each day is self-contained in its own package, with only basic I/O utils shared between them.
